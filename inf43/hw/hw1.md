## Client Interview
- A combination of a to-do list and a calendar
    - address the problems with human psychology and procrastination
### Dolendar
- do more and calendar
- create events that can happen at different time throughout the day
- to-do list is not on your calendar
    - you can decide when you want to do it
    - but they still take time
### New Idea
- when creating a to-do list
    - you assign duration to the items in the to-do list
    - the duration can vary from minutes to hours
- the calendar in weekly view
    - the days are chopped off in time blocks
    - you can see where you are at (current time)
    - you can see your tasks separated in time blocks
- you reserve time block for sleeping
- encourage people to use calendar or document everything you need to do
    - you can include eat dinner, sleep, watech TV program, etc.
    - it does not have to only include works or study but also hobbies or hanging out with friends
    - put them into the calendar and it will save that time to do your to-do list
- when tasks are not done, they will be pushed back automatically
    - you can see you have wasted so much time
    - ex. if you have a task that is between 4-4:30pm, nothing changes until it is 4:30pm and if you did not completed the task then everything will start moving down into the next day
    - you will be able to see that all tasks will take all your time until sunday night and you know that you will lose your weekend
    - it might encourage people to stop procrastinating as much or wasting their time on things that are not getting them towards their goals
- two main entities
    - events
        - things that are traditional on your calendar
        - events only happen at specific time
    - tasks
        - things that are on your to-do list
        - they flow around the events
        - maight need a traditional to-do list as well
            - with checkmark
-  software view that shows you all of the events and tasks that flow around

### Questions
- should the app has some sort of priority marker that can be put on certain tasks like setting some tasks are more important than the others
    - no, each task has a duration, and by seeing that it is using up your life, you do not put it on your task if it is not important
    - only the order matter because some tasks have to be done today and some can be done tomorrow
    - you can change the order of different tasks appear in the calendar
- should there a feature that allow users to assign an allowable time and they only appear on those time and if the task is not within the allowable time then it flow through next day at the same allowable time
    - no, it is too complicated at the moment
    - let the user move them manually
- what view do you want the calendar to have
    - weekly veiw
        - shows 7 days
    - day view
        - shows 24 hours
- how do you want to organize all the data on the calendar because you also have the to-do list
    - with a smaller screen
        - you will have different view
        - view with jsut the list
        - view with the calendar
            - can be either week based or day based
- do you want a start button to start working a task and it shows the process from 0% to 10, 30, 50 until 100%
    - no, because when a task is done and the user click it done, the entire thing goes away and creates a bunch of space and time can gives the user satifaction
- are there any metric that can be tracked and presented to the user to kind of give a sense for how much work they have coming up, how much work they have done, how many hours or days locked, how much procrastination, etc.
    - yes, there should be a panel or screen to display such stats
    - not the main focus of the app though
    - bonus feature
- should the app has push-based information
    - no, might be something in the future but not now
- what systems wil be kept compatible with
    - will be done in multiple phases
    - number 1 priority is development on mobile devices
        - support iOS and android simultaneously
        - in the scale of a mobile phone to a tablet
    - second phase
        - computer desktop
            - not sure if it is web-based
            - we need to figure it out ourselves
- any age restriction on the app
    no, the client wants his children to be involved in the app as early as possible
- how does the user change or update the status of a task to indicate it is either completed or partially completed
    - one option is deleting it if it is done
    - the primary way is having checkmark in the task list
        - check it and it disapperars from the calendar, then everything slides up
        - no partially done like 50% done
            - you can just edit the task duration
- another feature
    - outline view
        - you can have tasks as sub-task of another task
            - ex. 
        - each sub-task has their own duration
        - by checking out the sub-tasks the parent taks will have shorter duration
- in the calendar view, it should show the sub-tasks not the parent task
- do you want the app to offer assistance, automation, or suggestions for how long tasks should be baesd upon perhaps the history with use of the things
    - no, there should be a default duration
        - maybe too tedious to think about how long each task should take
        - the default duration can be just 30 minutes
        - the default duration can be changed
    - every new task created has defualt duration assigned, then the user change the duration as he want
- should there be a collaboration feature that in some way to do assignments, calendars
    - yes, it is the main way to make money
    - the app is free itself
    - for a personal calendar, you have gotten your own to-do list locally, nothing syncing
    - if you are working with someone else, it has to stored somewhere
    - you need cloud to share everyone's work
    - make money from corporations
    - paid tiers that allow the boss to put tasks on his employees' to-do list and get some visibility of what everybody's working
    - personal things should be hidden from others
    - require cloud service to sync
        - require maintiance
- do you want the app to send notifications or alerts
    - yes
