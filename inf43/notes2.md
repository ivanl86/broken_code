The biggest cost of a software is maintenance
Specification take small mount of time in a project but if it gets wrong it can cost a lot money

The category emplosy the most computer programmers in the U.S.
A. in-house staff writing systems for internal use

Customers give engineers the requirement of a software.

Requirements analysis
    activity of discovering/ observing/ garthering customer's needs
Requirements specification
    activity of describing/ documenting customer's needs
    can also refer to

techniques for requirements analysis
    interview customer
    observe customer
    create use cases/ scenarios/ user stories
    prototype solutions
    identify important objects/ roles/ functions/ goals
    perform research
    construct models

usage data is analyzed and business metrics are recorded to discover the value of new/ potential features
    techniques
        data analytics
        a/b testing
        protoyping
        market research

    this informatin is used to create/ prioritize/ analyze/ evaluate requirements

requirements specification
    it is to write the specification
    serves as the fundamental reference point between customer and software producer
    defines
        the "what" not the "how"sa
        environmental requirements on the software
        constraints on the software
        software qualities
    a requirements specification is the source for all future steps in the software life cycle
    changes are cheaper now than later

users of a requirements document
    customers
    developers
    managers
    testers
    documenters
    maintainers
    system engineers
    software architects
    marketing personnel
document structure
    introduction
    executive summary
    application context
    environmental requirements
    functional requirements
    software qualities
    time schedule
    potential risks
    assumptions
    future changes
    glossary
    reference documents

introduction
    what is this document about
    who created it
    an outline
    a short summary of what this program will do
executive summary
    short, succinct concise, to-the-point, desciption of the product
        no more than one page
    identifies
        main goals
        key features
        key risks/ obstel
appplication contes
    describes the sitaution in which the software will be used
        home, office, inside, outside,...
            ex. used by nurse in hospital
        identifies all thing that the system affects
            objects, processes, other software, heardware, and people
                ex. it runs on android phone
environmental requirements
    platforms
        hardware
            operating systems, types of machines, memory size, hard disk space
        software
            is it a web app? mobile app? desktop app?
            is it open source? linux
            is it enterprise software? .net?
        progrmming language(s)
        standard
functional requirements
    identifies all concepts, functions, features, and information that the system provides to its users
provides an abstraction for each of those, characterizing the properties and functions that are relevant to the user
    what is the system supposed to do?
    what information does the system need
    what is supposed to happen when something goes wrong
desired software "ilities" or non functional requirements
    correctness
    reliability
    efficiency
    usability
    maintainability
    protability
    reusability
    interoperability
    robustness
    security
    scalability
Other requirements
    what about cost?
    what about document

time schedule

potential risks
risks: future uncertain events with a probability of occurrence and a potential for loss
    any project faces risks
        new methodology
        requirements new to the group
        special skills and resource shortage
        aggressive shcedule
        tight funding
        security
        ethical
    it is importand to identify those risks up-front so you and the customer
assumptions
    factors that believed to be true during the life cycle
future changes
    any project faces changes over time
        it is important to identify 
glossary
    precise definitions of terms used throughout the reuqirement
reference document
user interface
    a approxiate ui is normally part fo a requirement
observations (about the specifications document)
    document is structure to address the fundamental
        rigor
        "erparation of concerns"
            modularity
            abstraction
    anticipation of shabe
    generaliuy
    incrementality
    not every project reuqires eeeee
Specification methods
    natural lanquage
    srs, user sotries
specification methodds

verication

acceptance test plan
often accompanies a requirements specification
specifies how it will be determined that each requirement is met
binds a customer to acceptthe delivered system if it passes all the tests

ziv's law
    software development is unpredictable and the documented artifacts such as requirements will never be fully understood
    uncertainty is inherent and inevitable in SE processes and products
