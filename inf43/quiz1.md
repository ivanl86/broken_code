# Course Quiz 1
### What is software engineering
- the process of constructing software
- phases of development other than programming
- principles and qualities of enduring value
- Lesser interest
    - managing and scheduling software development teams
    - making money
    - software's impact on users, organization, and society
- Three essential ingredients of software engineering
    - people (most important)
        - do the work
    - processes
        - organize and manage effort of individuals
    - tools
        - support people and processes
### Fundamental Principles
- rigor and formality
    - each developer imposes their own interest on the project which is diffcult to resolve when problems occur
    - setting rules into the proccess that all programmers must follow
    - lack of rigor can result in unreliable products, high costs, and time overrun
- separation of concerns
    - enhance the visibility, understandability, and maintainability of software systems
    - modularity
        - keep things in different modules which make them eaiser to maintain and debug
    - divide and conquer
        - separate a large problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them individually
        - complexity can be greatly reduced and better managed
    - abstraction
        - separation of important details from the unimportant ones
        - users do not have to know all the details behind software to know how to use it
            - ex. high level language hides the complicated bits from programmers
- anticipation of change
    - make sure everything is easy to change because there needs to be change
- generality
    - attempt to find a more general solutio which might be easier to solve or readily available
- incrementality
    - show the custmer preliminary versions of the software frequently
    - ensure it meets the custemer's requirements
    - create muti-version software to work to the requirement gradually
### Essential Porperties of Software
- complexity
    - software are complex, no two parts are alike and diffcult to understand
- conformity
    - software must conform to human system
- changeability
    - all successful software gets changed
    - most software survive beyond the life of hardware it was written for
- invisibility
    - reality of software not embedded in tangible space
    - hinders communication and understanding
### Three Perspectives on Software Engineering
- bussiness
    - cost, time, profit
- engineering
    - internal quality
- design
    - external quality
