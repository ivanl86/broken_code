Aggregation relationships are transitive and assymetric
    one object contains a set of other objects

information hiding
    hide design decisions that are most likely to change, thereby protecting other parts of the program from change if the design decision is changed
    showing only those details to the outside world which are necessary for the out side world and hiding all other  details from the out side world
