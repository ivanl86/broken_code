# Design Notes
## Dungeon
- 12 pits distributed randomly
    - use any rand func
- 1 Aldrac
- They should not be located at (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)
- 8 x 8
- enter/exit at (0, 0)
- 1 box of gold located at an undisclosed random location
location
- artifact locations are unknown
- none of these artifacts can share a room
- percepts are displayed as
    - G gold
    - S stench
    - B breeze
- user location displayed as U
- each cell displayed as 2 strings of 5 characters

## Perceptions
- all perceptions are only in directly adjacent rooms
- when in adjacent room to a pit, we sense a breeze (B)
- when in adjacent room to the Aldrac, we sense a stench (S)
- when in the room with the gold, we sense a glimmer
- perceptions are only displayed when the user enters a room and will be displayed for the rest of the game

## Movement
- R, L, U, D, and P to move Right, Left, Up, Down, and Pickup gold
- cannot move out of bounds (issue error message if attempted)
- cannot pickup gold in a empty room
- when carrying gold print message saying should

## Gameplay
- clear screen between moves
- if the user enters a room with a pit or Aldrac the game ends with a loss
- prompt to play again
- player wins if carrying gold and reaching (0, 0)

## Code
- clear instream after input
- case insensative input
